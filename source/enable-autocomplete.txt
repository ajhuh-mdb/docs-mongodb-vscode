autocomplete allows you to automatically populate database and collection 
names when using ``use("<database>")`` or 
``db.getCollection("collection_name")`` syntax within a MongoDB playground.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style:  connected

   .. step:: Open Settings.json
     
      a. In VSCode, open the command pallete:
         - MacOS: :kbd:`CMD` + :kbd:`SHIFT` + :kbd:`P`
         - Windows: :kbd:`CTRL` + :kbd:`SHIFT` + :kbd:`P`

      #. Enter :guilabel:`Open User Settings (JSON)` and select the option 
         from the autocompleted list:

         .. figure:: /images/vsce-command-palette-json-settings.png
            :figwidth: 700px
            :alt: Image of a stream connection

   .. step:: Add the autocomplete snippet to the ``Settings.json`` file
     
      Copy the following code snippet:

      .. code-block::

         "editor.quickSuggestions": {
            "other": true,
            "comments": false,
            "strings": true
         }

      Paste the code into the ``Settings.json``:

         .. figure:: /images/vsce-add-snippet-json-settings.png
            :figwidth: 700px
            :alt: Image of a stream connection

   .. step:: Test the autocompletion feature with db.getCollection()

      In a new VSCode playground connected to your deployment, 
      type the first two characters of a collection name between the 
      ``()`` and click the full name to populate the collection name:

      .. figure:: /images/vsce-get-collection-auto-complete.png
         :figwidth: 700px
         :alt: Get collection autocomplete

      .. note::

         You can press :kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`Space` on your keyboard to 
         autocomplete a collection name inside of the 
         ``db.getCollection()`` syntax.
