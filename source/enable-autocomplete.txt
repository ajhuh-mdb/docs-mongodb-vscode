About this Task
---------------

Optional.

Include important conceptual or behavioral information that's directly relevant 
to the task. If task-related information is extensive, consider a bulleted list 
that contains brief descriptions of important concepts and links to deeper reading.  

Before you Begin
----------------

Install the MongoDB VSCode extension.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style:  connected

   .. step:: Open Settings.json
     
      #. CMD + SHIFT + P - MacOS or CTRL + SHIFT + P - Windows
      #. Enter :guilabel:`Open User Settings (JSON)` and select the option 
         from the autocompleted list:

         .. figure:: /images/vsce-command-palette-json-settings.png
            :figwidth: 700px
            :alt: Image of a stream connection

   .. step:: Add the autocomplete snippet to the ``Settings.json`` file
     
      #. Copy the following code snippet:

      .. code-block::

         "editor.quickSuggestions": {
            "other": true,
            "comments": false,
            "strings": true
         }

      #. Paste the code into the ``Settings.json``:

         .. figure:: /images/vsce-add-snippet-json-settings.png
            :figwidth: 700px
            :alt: Image of a stream connection

   .. step:: Test the autocompletion feature with db.getCollection()

      #. In a new VSCode playground connected to your deployment, 
         type the first two characters of a collection name:

         .. figure:: /images/vsce-get-collection-auto-complete.png
            :figwidth: 700px
            :alt: Get collection autocomplete

         The full collection name populates in the autocomplete options.

         .. note::

            You can press ``Ctrl`` + ``Space`` on your keyboard to 
            autocomplete a collection name inside of the 
            ``db.getCollection()`` syntax.

Example
-------

Optional.

In some cases, you can work through a specific example throughout the steps. 
In others, it is helpful to show a complete example at the end. In most cases, 
it's helpful to include an example of what a successful result looks like. It 
could be a brief description, code block, or screenshot.
